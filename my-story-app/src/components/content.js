      <p>Swan Lake is a classical ballet depicting the tragic romance between Prince Siegfried and Princess Odette, a woman cursed by the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart to be a swan by day. Siegfried vows true love to break the spell, but is tricked into pledging himself to Odile, Von Rothbart's daughter, leading to a tragic end at the lake. </p>

      <p>There are four acts in the story:</p>
      <p>Act I: Prince Siegfried celebrates his 21st birthday and is told he must choose a bride at the upcoming royal ball.</p>
      <p>Act II: While hunting, Siegfried finds the swans and meets Odette, who transforms into a woman. She explains the spell: it can only be broken by a promise of eternal love.</p>
      <p>Act III: Von Rothbart disguises his daughter, Odile (the Black Swan), as Odette to deceive the Prince. Siegfried mistakenly declares his love for Odile, breaking his vow to Odette.</p>
      <p>Act IV: Realizing his error, a heartbroken Siegfried finds Odette at the lake. In most classical versions, they choose to die together to break the spell forever, although some productions feature a happier ending where they defeat Von Rothbart. </p>
